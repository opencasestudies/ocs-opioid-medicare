Medicare Part D is prescription drug coverage plan 
run by Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). 
[Here's a website describing the information about part D](https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d)
There are two ways for participaints to enroll in Medicare part D: 
(1) Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA-PDs), which comes 
along with other Medicare benefits (ex: Part A or Part B), and 
(2) stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP). 
That means that for those who have already enrolled in Medicare 
(either >= 65 years old 
or having certain diseases such as end-stage-renal-disease 
or other disabilities), they 
are eligible to join the Part D. 
( [See the Medicare Part A and Part B for more information.](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/medicare-and-medicaid/who-is-elibible-for-medicare/index.html) and [The eligibility for Medicare among those under 65.](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-eligibility-overview/medicare-eligibility-for-those-under-65) ).
For people enrolled in other insurance plan, they may 
also be eligible to apply for the plan. [Other insurance](https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/how-part-d-works-with-other-insurance).




========================================

Medicare Part D was originally proposed by President Bill Clinton in 2000. It was based on earlier proposals developed by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Senator Tom Daschle. These late-1990s/2000 proposals—with the exception of the spend phase structure but including the fact that Medicare itself would not do the negotiating—are substantially the same as the current Part D.

At the start of the program in January 2006, it was expected that eleven million people would be covered by Medicare Part D; of those, six million would be dual eligible. About two million people who were covered by employers would likely lose their employee benefits.

As of January 30, 2007, nearly 24 million individuals were receiving prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D (PDPs and MA-PDs combined), according to CMS.[17] Medicare offers other methods of receiving drug coverage, including the Retiree Drug Subsidy. Federal retiree programs such as TRICARE and Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) or alternative sources, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. Including people in these categories, more than 39 million Americans are covered for prescriptions by the federal government.

A survey released by AARP in November 2007 found that 85% of enrollees reported satisfaction with their drug plan, and 78% said that they had made a good choice in selecting their plan.[18]
